# Benchmark — pgschema vs pg-delta parity status

This directory tracks parity between resolved pgschema issues and pg-delta.
Each benchmark file documents a scenario that was previously missing or
insufficient in pg-delta.

## Active benchmarked gaps after refresh

Only this resolved-issue benchmark scenario remains active as unresolved:

- **020** — `UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT` on table constraints

There is no parity-state delta versus the 2026-05-23 refresh: benchmark 020
remains the only active resolved-issue gap.

## New open pgschema issue screening (draft-only output)

Screened candidates:

- **#362** numeric precision changes — **covered** in pg-delta integration tests
- **#401** `RETURNS SETOF <table>` dependency ordering — **covered** in pg-delta integration tests
- **#404** deferrable unique constraints — **tracked** by [pg-toolbelt#218](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/issues/218)
- **#366** function privilege signatures with enum argument types — **tracked** by [pg-toolbelt#219](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/issues/219)
- **#408** quoted custom / reserved type names in plan output — **covered** in the current pg-delta source path; column types come from `format_type(...)` and quoted custom types are exercised in `type-operations.test.ts`
- **#436** required extensions in dump output — **covered** in pg-delta's extension model and integration coverage (`src/core/objects/extension/`, `tests/integration/extension-operations.test.ts`)
- **#418** `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` on partitioned parents — **no duplicate pg-toolbelt issue drafted**; this is specific to pgschema's online-DDL rewrite and pg-delta does not synthesize `CONCURRENTLY`
- **#420 / #421 / #422** array-typmod and quoted-name dump edge cases — **no pg-toolbelt issue drafted yet**; current pg-delta source looks closer to correct than pgschema, but the exact scenarios are still missing dedicated roundtrip coverage
- **#427** schema-qualified functions in RLS policy expressions — **not covered**; draft issue text saved in [`docs/parity-issue-drafts-2026-05-23.md`](../docs/parity-issue-drafts-2026-05-23.md)
- **#439** replacing `UNIQUE` with `PRIMARY KEY` when dependents still point at the old constraint — **not covered**; draft issue text saved in [`docs/parity-issue-drafts-2026-05-23.md`](../docs/parity-issue-drafts-2026-05-23.md)
- **#406 / #407 / #409 / #429** `.pgschemaignore` follow-ups — **not parity work for pg-delta** (pgschema-specific ignore-file surface area)
- **#49** explicit rename / refactor workflow proposal — **not parity work for pg-delta**; this is a pgschema-specific workflow design, not a current pg-delta diff or planning gap

Historical draft text is recorded in markdown for both the older tracked
scenarios and the newly screened uncovered candidates:

- [`docs/parity-issue-drafts-2026-04-22.md`](../docs/parity-issue-drafts-2026-04-22.md)
- [`docs/parity-issue-drafts-2026-05-23.md`](../docs/parity-issue-drafts-2026-05-23.md)

## Recent closed-issue screening notes

- **#412** `UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT` on table constraints — **not covered** in
  the current pg-delta constraint path; benchmarked as [020](020-unique-constraint-nulls-not-distinct.md)
- **#423** `UNLOGGED` tables — **covered** in pg-delta's table persistence
  extraction and diff logic (`relpersistence`, `SET UNLOGGED`, `SET LOGGED`)
