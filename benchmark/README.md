# Benchmark - pgschema vs pg-delta parity status

This directory tracks parity between resolved pgschema issues and pg-delta.
Each benchmark file documents a scenario that was previously missing or
insufficient in pg-delta.

## Active benchmarked gaps after refresh

Two resolved-issue benchmark scenarios remain active as unresolved behavior:

- **021** - child-specific `DEFAULT` / `NOT NULL` column overrides in
  `CREATE TABLE ... PARTITION OF ...`
- **022** - PostgreSQL 18 `VIRTUAL` generated columns

Source inspection on 2026-08-26 current heads still shows:

- benchmark **021** remains structurally uncovered because
  `repos/pg-toolbelt/packages/pg-delta/src/extract/relations.ts` still filters
  child-inherited columns with `a.attislocal`, and
  `repos/pg-toolbelt/packages/pg-delta/src/plan/rules/tables.ts` still emits
  only a bare `CREATE TABLE ... PARTITION OF ... FOR VALUES ...` form with no
  child-local column-element list
- benchmark **022** remains structurally uncovered because
  `repos/pg-toolbelt/packages/pg-delta/src/extract/relations.ts` still collapses
  `attgenerated` to `generatedExpr`, and
  `repos/pg-toolbelt/packages/pg-delta/src/plan/rules/helpers.ts` still renders
  generated columns as `... STORED`
- the only `packages/pg-delta` diff from the previous parity head is
  `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json`; the functional code movement is in
  `packages/pg-topo/*` privilege payload handling and does not touch the active
  benchmark codepaths above
- the focused 2026-08-14 runtime probes remain the latest direct runtime
  evidence for both scenarios; nothing in the 2026-08-26 state changes those
  specific codepaths
- comments on the umbrella tracker
  [pg-toolbelt#332](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/issues/332)
  now carry both fidelity-gap notes, but there is still no dedicated exact
  issue or PR for either benchmark

## Open pgschema issue screening (current state)

The current open pgschema issue set is unchanged from 2026-08-25:
[#49](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/issues/49),
[#52](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/issues/52),
[#84](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/issues/84),
[#450](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/issues/450),
and [#557](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/issues/557).

Screened candidates:

- **#49** explicit rename / refactor workflow proposal - **not parity
  work for pg-delta**
- **#52** explicit before / after SQL file execution in plan output -
  **not parity work for pg-delta**
- **#84** feedback / testimonial collection thread - **not parity work
  for pg-delta**
- **#450** missing role blocks plan/apply - **not parity work for
  pg-delta**; this remains specific to pgschema's desired-state temp
  schema workflow, while pg-delta diffs live catalogs directly
- **#557** lock timeout and retries for busy-table migrations - **not
  parity work for pg-delta today**; current pg-delta already exposes
  `lockTimeoutMs` on `apply()` and bounded retries in the shadow SQL-file
  loader, but this new pgschema request is about a live-target execution
  retry policy rather than a schema-diff fidelity gap

There is currently **no dedicated exact open pg-toolbelt parity tracker** for
the active benchmarks above or for the older draft-only gaps
[#439](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/issues/439) /
[#444](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/issues/444). The remaining active
benchmarks **021** / **022** are only adjacently tracked under the open
umbrella fidelity issue
[pg-toolbelt#332](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/issues/332):
keyword duplicate searches still surface that issue, and comments on the issue
thread carry both gap notes, but there is still no dedicated issue or PR for
either benchmark.

## Recent closed-issue / tracker updates

- no additional parity-adjacent pgschema issues changed state between
  2026-08-25 and 2026-08-26; the only upstream delta in today's refresh is the
  pg-toolbelt head advance to `6f480e6ed707133e13bd76c5ff3a8df6102806ee`
  (`@supabase/pg-delta@1.0.0-alpha.47`), which does not close the active
  benchmarks

- **#493** `--qualify-schema` type-reference follow-up - closed on
  2026-08-21 and remains **not parity work for pg-delta**; the issue is still
  about pgschema's desired-schema render / IR fidelity rather than pg-delta's
  live-catalog diff surface
- **#404** deferrable unique constraints - **covered** in current
  pg-delta; exact tracker
  [pg-toolbelt#218](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/issues/218)
  closed on 2026-08-09 after the clean-room rewrite landed
- **#366** enum-arg function privilege signatures - **covered** in
  current pg-delta; exact tracker
  [pg-toolbelt#219](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/issues/219)
  closed on 2026-08-09 after the clean-room rewrite landed
- **#551** removing an explicit RLS `WITH CHECK` clause - closed by
  [pgschema#554](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/pull/554) and remains
  **covered** in current pg-delta;
  `repos/pg-toolbelt/packages/pg-delta/src/plan/rules/policies.ts` still
  rebuilds policies when `usingExpr` / `checkExpr` changes, and
  `src/plan/policy-clause-removal.test.ts` still pins the clause-removal path
- **#552** cross-schema partition child planning with an external plan database
  - closed by [pgschema#555](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/pull/555) and
  remains **not parity work for pg-delta**; the merged fix adds cross-schema
  partition-parent stubs in `repos/pgschema/cmd/plan/partition_stubs.go`,
  while pg-delta still diffs live catalogs directly and its active partition
  benchmark remains the separate child-override gap
  [021](021-partition-child-column-overrides.md)
- **#553** external plan database rejects `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` in
  Supabase-style plans - closed by
  [pgschema#556](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/pull/556) and remains
  **not parity work for pg-delta**; the merged fix adds temporary role stubs
  for pgschema's external plan database, while current pg-delta already
  exercises default-privilege planning in Supabase-style contexts through
  `src/plan/rules/default-privilege.test.ts` and
  `src/policy/supabase-default-privileges.test.ts`
- **#412** `UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT` on table constraints - now
  **covered** in current pg-delta; benchmark [020](020-unique-constraint-nulls-not-distinct.md)
  is retained as a historical record
- **#518** extension-owned type schema mismatch - closed by
  [pgschema#544](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/pull/544) and still
  **not parity work for pg-delta**
- **#519** view normalization through the temporary plan schema - closed by
  [pgschema#520](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/pull/520) and still
  **not parity work for pg-delta**
- **#534** self-referencing FK to a non-PK standalone unique index on the same
  table - closed by [pgschema#540](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/pull/540)
  and remains **covered** in current pg-delta
- **#535** domain created over a table row type - closed by
  [pgschema#539](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/pull/539) and remains
  **covered** in current pg-delta
- **#536** dropping a foreign-keyed table/column in the wrong order - closed
  upstream and remains **covered** in current pg-delta
- **#537** built-in `ALTER COLUMN TYPE` without a `USING` clause - closed by
  [pgschema#541](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/pull/541), remains
  **covered** in current pg-delta, and matches the solved benchmark family in
  [005](005-alter-column-type-using-clause.md)
- **#538** dropping a table with a trigger - closed upstream; current pg-delta
  already has trigger-drop-before-function-drop coverage (historical tracker
  [pg-toolbelt#137](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/issues/137) plus
  the `trigger-operations--trigger-drop-before-function-drop` corpus scenario)
- **#545** function signature depends on a deferred table row type - closed by
  [pgschema#546](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/pull/546); current
  pg-delta already resolves routine signature dependencies on relation row
  types through `pg_depend` in
  `repos/pg-toolbelt/packages/pg-delta/src/extract/dependencies.ts`, so no new
  benchmark file or duplicate tracker is needed
- **#548** cross-schema FK to `auth.users` when the `auth` schema is
  intentionally excluded from a pgschema dump - closed by
  [pgschema#549](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/pull/549) and remains
  **not parity work for pg-delta**; pg-delta diffs live catalogs directly and
  already carries `auth`-schema fixtures, so no benchmark or duplicate tracker
  change is needed
- **#499** child-specific column elements on `PARTITION OF` create -
  still **not covered in current behavior**, with only umbrella-thread context
  from [pg-toolbelt#332](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/issues/332);
  benchmarked as [021](021-partition-child-column-overrides.md)
- **#501** PostgreSQL 18 `VIRTUAL` generated columns - still **not covered in
  current behavior**, with only umbrella-thread context from
  [pg-toolbelt#332](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/issues/332);
  benchmarked as [022](022-virtual-generated-columns.md)
- **#506** new-table FK before standalone unique index - **covered** in
  current pg-delta; benchmark [023](023-fk-before-standalone-unique-index.md)
  is retained as a historical record
- draft-only gaps [#439](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/issues/439)
  and [#444](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/issues/444) still have no
  exact pg-toolbelt issue or PR

## Upstream watch list

- there are still **no open pgschema PRs in parity-adjacent scope**, and none
  were newly merged between 2026-08-25 and 2026-08-26; the last such change
  remains [pgschema#556](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/pull/556), which
  merged on 2026-08-21 to close
  [#553](https://github.com/pgplex/pgschema/issues/553) as a pgschema-specific
  external-plan concern rather than a pg-delta parity gap
- checked-in/live `pg-toolbelt` now sits at
  `6f480e6ed707133e13bd76c5ff3a8df6102806ee`
- checked-in/live `pgschema` now sits at
  `9a09fe5861575ccfc71c7387ce3524b502992a97`
- comments on open umbrella issue
  [#332](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/issues/332) remain the
  closest tracker context for benchmarks **021** / **022**
- current open pg-toolbelt PRs
  [#449](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/pull/449),
  [#444](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/pull/444),
  [#432](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/pull/432),
  [#303](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/pull/303),
  [#302](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/pull/302), and
  [#288](https://github.com/supabase/pg-toolbelt/pull/288) are useful current
  context, but none is a dedicated exact duplicate of benchmarks **021** /
  **022** or the draft-only gaps **#439** / **#444**
